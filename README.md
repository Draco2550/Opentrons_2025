# Opentrons_2025
I'm proud to share the scripts I developed during my rewarding internship at Opentrons. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to contribute and for the valuable skills I gained. These scripts should lower production time and cost for working with protocols by making it easier to batch audit and simulate.
