# Opentrons_2025
I'm proud to share the scripts I developed during my rewarding internship at Opentrons. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to contribute and for the valuable skills I gained. These scripts should lower production time and cost for working with protocols by making it easier to batch audit and simulate.

# Highlights
The best part of these tools would be the amount of time it could save you!
- It can look over all your protocols in a folder with the Audit.py script.
  - Providing details on things such as the metadata, what modules it uses, the R.T.P in the file, inform you about possible z-height issues, and lastly, what type of resoivors it requires.
- The Find_Replace_Z.py file that does what it says, it will find instances of z-height issues and replace them for you with the threshold that you provide within a folder.
- If you need to generate randomized files to test out all different extreme combinations that are possible with your protocol use Randomized_RTP.py
